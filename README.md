# process-manager
The Dyspro Process manager.

Reminder the process manager is the most essential thing for the dyspro discord bot & the web dashboard to work as a background task and simultaneously watch over the RAM and memory usage of the process. Simultaneous **un-used cache** deletion will be added to the `daemon` in the future. This is a bare bone process manager with tabular graphics and a respawn daemon.

Start it with 

```cd daemon && make```
And then 
```cd.. && make install```
